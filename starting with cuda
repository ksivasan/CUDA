Indexing and stride:

  int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;
  
No. of blocks calculation

  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
 
max no. of threads possible: 1024

using unit8 and dim3
  we can't use values greater than 64 for z
  x, y, z cannot take value 0 or x*y*z greater than 1024
